As I already had some basics in HTML, this lesson gave me the opportunity to review some basics.
So for me, this has been easy. I havenâ€™t encountered any difficulty, yet.
As for the problem solving strategies, in order to make sure that everything was correct, for each modification I made, I verified that it was correct by refreshing the web page.
